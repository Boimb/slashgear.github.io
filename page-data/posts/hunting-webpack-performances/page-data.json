Create them if they don‚Äôt exist!</strong></p>\n<h2>What was the problem with webpack ?</h2>\n<p>For several weeks/months my colleagues have been complaining about the duration of our <code class=\"language-text\">yarn build</code> command.\nThe purpose of this command is to build the distributable package of our application in a production target with <em>webpack</em>.</p>\n<p>I even heard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‚ÄúThis command, I don‚Äôt run it locally anymore, it takes too much time.‚Äù</li>\n<li>‚ÄúMy computer starts ventilating heavily every time I run this command. There‚Äôs nothing else I can do!‚Äù</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the machine on which the build was launched, it tooks <strong>between 5 and 12 minutes</strong>.\nIt is not possible to have a build that takes so long.\n<code class=\"language-text\">webpack</code> is not a slow bundler.\nIt is our use of <code class=\"language-text\">webpack</code> that makes it slow.</p>\n<h2>Focus error, a morning lost</h2>\n<p>Since this command launches a webpack build in <code class=\"language-text\">production</code> mode, I figured out that the culprit was webpack config itself.\nGiven that I‚Äôve dug deep into webpack, I thought it would be interesting to focus on this performance concern.\nI have indeed open sourced a set of workshop to learn how to use webpack from scratch (<a href=\"https://webpack-workshop.netlify.com\">https://webpack-workshop.netlify.com</a>).\nSo at the end of January I took one day to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>I had my own idea of the task that would take the most. So I tried to improve it, spending my entire morning on it.\nI just managed to <strong>gain 17 seconds</strong>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not going to lie, I was very disappointed with what I achieved.</p>\n<p>The concern in my strategy was however obvious.\nI started off with a preconceived idea <em>‚ÄúThis is definitely the stage that takes the longest.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>Nothing was objective in my analysis.\nTo improve the performance of an application it is necessary to focus on objective facts.</p>\n<h2>Successful afternoon</h2>\n<p>When I came back from my lunch break, I was motivated to win more than those poor 17 seconds.\nThen I remembered the Pareto principle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is probably one step that takes up most of the webpack build time.\nPareto principle adapted to webpack could mean <em>‚Äú80% of the build time is caused by 20% of the config‚Äù</em></p>\n<p><em>Let‚Äôs find the culprit ! üéâ</em></p>\n<p>I had to determine the build time of each loader, of each plugin.\nI was very lucky, the webpack community has already proposed a plugin that allows to measure everything.\nAnd it is very easy to install. ‚ô•Ô∏è</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/speed-measure-webpack-plugin\">Speed Measure Plugin</a></p>\n<p>Here are the results I got:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">SMP  ‚è±\nGeneral output time took 4 mins, 5.68 secs\n\n SMP  ‚è±  Plugins\nIgnorePlugin took 57.73 secs\nTerserPlugin took 39.022 secs\nExtractCssChunksPlugin took 3.13 secs\nOptimizeCssAssetsWebpackPlugin took 1.6 secs\nManifestPlugin took 1.55 secs\nWebpackPwaManifest took 0.326 secs\nContextReplacementPlugin took 0.129 secs\nHashedModuleIdsPlugin took 0.127 secs\nGenerateSW took 0.059 secs\nDefinePlugin took 0.047 secs\nEnvironmentPlugin took 0.04 secs\nLoadablePlugin took 0.033 secs\nObject took 0.024 secs\n\n SMP  ‚è±  Loaders\nbabel-loader, and\nrev-replace-loader took 2 mins, 11.99 secs\n  module count = 2222\nmodules with no loaders took 1 min, 57.86 secs\n  module count = 2071\nextract-css-chunks-webpack-plugin, and\ncss-loader, and\npostcss-loader, and\nsass-loader took 1 min, 43.74 secs\n  module count = 95\ncss-loader, and\npostcss-loader, and\nsass-loader took 1 min, 43.61 secs\n  module count = 95\nfile-loader, and\nrev-replace-loader took 4.86 secs\n  module count = 43\nfile-loader took 2.67 secs\n  module count = 32\nraw-loader took 0.446 secs\n  module count = 1\n@bedrock/package-json-loader took 0.005 secs\n  module count = 1\nscript-loader took 0.003 secs\n  module count = 1</code></pre></div>\n<p>As expected, it‚Äôs not great!\nBut at least I‚Äôm starting to get who the culprits are.\nWe can see that for 2222 Javascript modules takes up 2mins <strong>but</strong> for only 95 Sass files 1min43 ü§£.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 45.416666666666664%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/PjNx7g5jtLyJtvDohb\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<h3>Damn node-sass</h3>\n<p>Once the migration from <code class=\"language-text\">node-sass</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">sass</code> (new Sass re-implementation) and the update of <code class=\"language-text\">sass-loader</code>, I was shocked!\nIt took me about 10 minutes because there were few breaking changes and I <strong>gained more than 1min30</strong> on the build time.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">sass-loader</code> made big improvements on performances, you should definitely make sure you use the last version.</p>\n<p><strong>I lost a morning on gaining 17 seconds and I spent 10 minutes to win 1min30.ü§£</strong></p>\n<h3>IgnorePlugin, TerserPlugin</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">TerserPlugin</code> is used to uglify the javascript code in order to reduce its size and readability. It‚Äôs a relatively long process, but <em>39 seconds</em> is too much.\nJust by updating the version of TerserPlugin to use the one integrated in Webpack, I managed to <strong>reduce by 20 seconds</strong> the build time.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">IgnorePlugin</code> is a core plugin that was used a lot in our application to avoid loading certain scripts in order to reduce the weight of the site.\nIt was necessary, but today with Webpack we can use much better than that. <em>Dynamic Import, ContextReplacement</em>, there are plenty of solutions. As a general rule, we should avoid compiling files and then not using them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recommendations from the community</h3>\n<p>To improve the build perfs webpack provides a web page listing the actions to take to hunt what takes time.\nI strongly advise to have a look at it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/\">https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/</a></p>\n<h2>Final Result</h2>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">    SMP  ‚è±\n    General output time took 2 mins, 18.27 secs</code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/3rUbeDiLFMtAOIBErf\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>Based on precise and concrete measures, I was able to drastically improve the webpack build of my application.\nNo more computers suffering just to compile a bit of JS and SASS.\nI could have lost whole days on futile modifications if I had not measured precisely what penalized the build.</p>\n<p>‚ÑπÔ∏è</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code class=\"language-text\">Speed Measure Plugin</code> to debug webpack build time</li>\n<li>Track your build time evolution to detect big evolution before merge</li>\n<li>Follow webpack performances recommandations</li>\n<li>Look at webpack 5 new caching strategies</li>\n<li>Keep your webpack config up to date</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to boost the speed of your webpack build?","date":"March 01, 2020","description":"A story of performance optimization and application of the Pareto principle to a webpack build that has become far too long."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hunting-webpack-performances/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn-webpack/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Learning webpack Step By Step"}},"next":null}}}
