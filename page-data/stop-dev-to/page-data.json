I was quickly confronted with an obvious problem. It is difficult to “make” a small personal blog live in a web world where social networks are taking up more and more space.</p>\n<p>By publishing on my personal blog, I had a small audience. It was difficult for my articles to get passed my first level contacts range.</p>\n<p>I was therefore quickly tempted to find a solution to remedy this visibility problem. The solution presented by one of my colleagues seemed attractive to me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Why don’t you try the new Medium platform? Authors who publish on Medium have thousands of readers! Also, the editing interface is pretty cool!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s what I did. I stopped publishing on my personal blog and started writing and publishing my posts on Medium only. And do I regret it today.</p>\n<p><strong>And then unfortunately the story went wrong!</strong></p>\n<p>Medium, in only a few months, and following some business decisions, has really become a platform to avoid.</p>\n<p>User tracking, advertising, a paywall, a real disgusting cocktail that would make <a href=\"https://www.laquadrature.net/en/\">“la quadrature du net”</a> scream. Many people have decided to leave the platform as a result of these decisions.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying Dev.to will suffer the same fate. I’m not a medium, I don’t have the ability to see into the future. But in practice, Dev.to remains a company and thus is tied to financial issues. And the stability of Dev.to’s <em>Business Model</em> is rather obscure.</p>\n<p>You really have to trust the team so that Dev.to doesn’t go in the wrong direction. I would very much like to hear Ben Halpern’s opinion on this subject.</p>\n<h1 id=\"so-we-should-stop-writing-on-devto-\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#so-we-should-stop-writing-on-devto-\" aria-label=\"so we should stop writing on devto  permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>So we should stop writing on Dev.to ?</h1>\n<p><strong>The answer is NO</strong></p>\n<p>Dev.to is great, and have an amazing community. <strong>But</strong>, authors should not post their blog content only on Dev.to.</p>\n<p>We should follow the <strong>P.O.S.S.E</strong> principle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Respecting it will help authors being and staying responsible of their publications on the Internet. This will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>protect the web from hyper-centralization</li>\n<li>avoid having your copyrights stolen</li>\n<li>promote your blog</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All authors should have their own personal blog where they publish the content. They can then share this content on other platforms by placing a <code class=\"language-text\">canonical url</code> pointing to their own blog page.</p>\n<p>Dev.to has this feature, which is very rare. <strong>I would really like this feature to be highlighted</strong> so that the authors are aware of the problem.</p>\n<p>For example, this post is available on <a href=\"https://slashgear.github.io/posts/stop-dev-to/\">my personal blog</a> and its content is shared here on Dev.to.</p>\n<p>I also worked on a project for an open source syndication platform named <a href=\"https://open-blog.dev/\">“Open Blog”</a> in order to raise awareness about not being the owner of your content.
